         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He reſolv'd therefore to traine up his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in learning, not onely that it might be an ornament to them,<note place="margin">Nihil ſordidius imo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delius quam ſi rempubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roderet, qui nihil in eam ſuo labore conferret.

Our <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> (one of the younger brothers) after he was furniſht with a competency of Grammar learning, was ſent to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and admitted into <hi>C.

                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:37480:10"/>
                  <p>When he was about eighteen years of Age, he fell dangerouſly ſick in the Colledge, and was very farre ſpent, and near unto death before thoſe about him underſtood his diſtemper; 'till anon a skilful Phyſitian coming in, and finding it to be a Pleuriſie, gave order that a veine ſhould be forthwith opened; whereupon a Chirurgeon was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſent for, but it was long ere he could be found; at length the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brought him from a Táverne, and though he ſaw the way thither, yet he did not know how to do his work when he came there; he ſtrook the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients arme twice, but no more blood came then if he had prickt him in the palme of his hand; In this poſture the ſottiſh Chirurgion leaves him (it being late) all night; but when he had ſlept himſelf ſober, he came the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning very early, and knockt at the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Gate, which being open'd, he haſtily ran to his Chamber, and askt if he were yet alive? and coming in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently open'd a veine in his Arme which bled freely, and the Patient (half dead) ſoon after recover'd &amp; grew well again.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:37480:11"/>
                  <p>Another ſtrange deliverance he met with a little after; when he was newly Batchelour of Arts, going into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alone to waſh himſelf, and not being able to ſwim, he fell into a deep hole where his feet could feel no bottome, but (as the Providence of God order'd it) he caught hold of a little turfe of Graſs by the bankſide, by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he climb'd up the bank: if that little hold had fail'd him, he had in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability miſcarried.</p>
                  <p>Theſe mercifull deliverances and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations were preparatory to that good work, which about this time God began in his heart: for about the year 1620. (to uſe his own words which I have by me in a manuſcript under his own hand) <hi>I had many ſad and ſerious thoughts concerning my ſpiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eſtate. Then upon the advice of</hi> Dr Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft <hi>I bought</hi> Brinſley's <hi>watch (the ſecond part) where the ſins againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are ſet down in order, and I fell upon the work of examination; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this ſeems remarkeable, that reading over the ſeveral ſins there mention'd, my heart (ſuch was the blindneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37480:11"/>of it) cry'd, not guilty of any one of them; whereupon I began to ſuſpect my heart, and calling upon God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten mine eyes, and diſcover my ſins to me, and then reading them over again, I judg'd my ſelf guilty, very guilty even of moſt of the ſins there ſet down and enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated. After this I lay about two months under a ſpirit of bondage, being full of fears and inward trouble, ſo that many times I durſt not cloſe mine eyes in the night leaſt I ſhould awake in Hell; I thought every night the Devil would come for me, and fetch me away: but anon the Lord was graciouſly pleas'd to ſhine upon me, and this remarkeable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage I ſhall never forget, That being one evening at prayer all alone in the Darke,</hi> (<hi>I remember the Chamber in</hi> C. C. C. <hi>and the corner of the Chamber well</hi>) <hi>I was very earneſt with God for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his love to my ſoule, and the aſſurance of pardon for my ſins, and at length I brake out into theſe words (or words to this purpoſe) Lord I will not cut off thy preſence,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>From this time he apply'd himſelf to the diligent reading of the Scripture, and to the ſtudy of Divinity; and when he was Maſter of Arts, his Father will'd him to chooſe his profeſſion, whether that of a Lawyer, a Phyſitian, or a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; he readily pitcht upon the latter, telling his Father that he had for ſome time paſt inclin'd his ſtudies that way, and that he eſteem'd the turning of ſoules to righteouſneſs to be the moſt deſireable work in all the world, and that it would have the greater reward hereafter,<note place="margin">

So acceptable were his labours during his abode there, that hearers from all parts round about flockt to him, <hi>as the Doves to their Windowes.</hi> This was not very pleaſing to him who was incumbent there; he therefore ſpent the more time in reading Prayers, that this novel lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer might have the leſſe for Preaching his Sermons: and when he had protract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Common Prayers all he could, he himſelf would go out of the Church, being followed by no one but his Clark, whom he would not ſuffer to call a <hi>Pſalme,</hi> but the Lecturer himſelf, or one Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> (an inhabitant of the Town, one that fear'd God above many) was faine to ſupply his roome.

                  </p>
                  <p>His Father and friends had now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a place for him, <hi>viz.

There he Preacht and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiz'd on the Lords Dayes, and other days, to the great benefit of his hearers who attended his Miniſtry, not only thoſe that dwelt in <hi>Buſhy,</hi> but thoſe that liv'd at <hi>Watford,</hi> and other adjacent places.

                  <p>Being call'd upon to Preach a Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Sermon, he perform'd it with great approbation, only becauſe he inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt <hi>non-reſidency</hi> and <hi>pluralities,</hi> ſome that were concerned were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended, one of them ſaying, <hi>he might the better ſpeak againſt many li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, having got ſo good a one himſelf.</hi>

                  <p>Recommending of himſelf unto the <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> to fix the Bounds of his habitation for him; his firſt flight was to <hi>Rickmerſworth,</hi> a ſmall Market Town in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> where he had not been long, but he had a very kind <hi>welcome,</hi> both from the <hi>Gentry,</hi> as a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and other <hi>good Chriſtians</hi> of inferiour rank, as a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>His <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>chief</hi> deſign, when a little acquainted in the place, was to make way for the ſettlement of an <hi>able

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37480:19"/>be alike good,</hi> Eccl. 11.6. ſo that in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>great Apoſtle,</hi> by the power of the Spirit of God, he even <hi>from Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, round about to Illyricum fully Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>So this excellent Miniſter of our Lord Jeſus, from <hi>Rickmerſworth</hi> even round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout unto the utmoſt borders of the <hi>County,</hi> and into the neighbouring <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> alſo, he was <hi>ſpending,</hi> and being <hi>ſpent</hi> in the ſervice of his great <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter.</hi>

                  <p>Having paſſed, I think, ſome two yeares; his wife now labouring under ſome <hi>weakneſſes,</hi> and being weary with the <hi>burden</hi> of <hi>houſhold affairs,</hi> he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Chamber or two in a private Family ſome miles diſtant, where he was very <hi>uſeful;</hi> he much <hi>inlightned,</hi> and quickly <hi>leavened</hi> the habitation: his <hi>Miniſterial Gifts</hi> and graces were ſuch, as that indeed he <hi>perfumed</hi> the whole <hi>houſe.</hi> As long as he lived there, there was a <hi>Church</hi> alwayes in that <hi>houſe;</hi> and I preſume the govenour, and children, and ſervants, do bleſs God for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and conference, and exemplary converſation, to this day, and may they never looſe the <hi>ſavour of the knowledg of Chriſt, and the ſenſe of the power of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37480:20"/>world to come,</hi> that he manifeſted, and they were under, during his abode with them. From thence he removed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther private family (and I believe his frequent removes were, that he might have renewed opportunity of doing more good, and God more ſervice) where he was entertained as an <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> This Family was near S. <hi>Albans,</hi> in which Town, from that time he was a great inſtrument in the hand of <hi>God</hi> for good, to correct ſome <hi>extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> amongſt ſome <hi>people</hi> there, by his <hi>ſober principles,</hi> and great <hi>moderation</hi> of ſpirit, and the noble exerciſes of <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> being no burden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any, but being <hi>crafty, catching them with guile,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.16.</p>
                  <p>His laſt remove was to a place called <hi>Bovingden,</hi> a little village; and I queſtion whether ever it had been mentioned in any ſtory, if this good man had not liv'd and ended his <hi>days</hi> there; he was led thither by the invitation of <hi>a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and very kind <hi>Gentleman,</hi> freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating him, with all the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of an <hi>habitation</hi> of his in that place. But he once told me, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37480:21"/>was ſaved that way, he ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended proportionably in <hi>charitable uſes,</hi> making conſcience to give it either in <hi>mony</hi> or <hi>books</hi> to the <hi>poor,</hi> to this and the <hi>neighbouring</hi> places; and I believe he hath deſtributed ſeveral hundreds of ſhort Catechiſms, beſides ſome dozens of little books (of that great light of our age) Entitled <hi>The call to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> During his abode here, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued daily to attend the duty of the Family, wherein he was <hi>inſtructing</hi> the ſouls belonging thereunto. And if one or more of the poor of that place chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to come in, he would ſay, they were welcome, and that God came along with them, and the poor have the Goſpel preached unto them. In this place he enjoy'd great privacy, which he greatly priz'd; and had be been born for himſelf alone, he could alwayes have choſen to have liv'd thus alone. How many worthy's in the world have prefer'd retirement to the greateſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments in Church or State, and have thought Scepters and Myters not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be compared with it. But he could not thus ſatifie himſelf: that of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37480:21"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> was often in his mouth, <hi>Wo be to me if I preach not the Goſpel;</hi> he was of <hi>Calvins</hi> mind, who would not his Lord ſhould come and find him idle. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he rode often to St. <hi>Albans</hi> or ſome other adjacent place, and once or twice a year to <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Kingſton;</hi> and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he could not preach in a Church to many, he would preach in a Chamber to a few. Tis not the place or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that commends our preaching to God. What excellent Sermons have been preacht to deſpicable auditories, and in very ordinary and contemptible pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Pauls</hi> meeting place in <hi>Macedonia</hi> was the River ſide,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 16.13.</note> and his hearers a few of the weaker Sex: Our Lord himſelf preacht a long Sermon once to one ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous man;<note place="margin">

                  <p>Thus this eminent ſervant of God, like a torch or candle with lighting others, conſumed and waſted himſelf. On the eighth of <hi>July Anno Dom.</hi> 1671. <hi>&amp; aetatis ſuae</hi> 71. he was ſeiz'd all on one ſide with the dead palſy, by reaſon of which his ſpeech much faild him,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37480:22"/>ſo that he ſpake little and ſeldome. A friend coming to viſit him, and asking him how he did, he anſwered in the words of the Prophet, <hi>In meaſure God debateth with me, and in the day of the Eaſt-wind he ſtayeth his rough wind.</hi> A while after he ſaid to a friend that ſtood by him; I neither fear death, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire life, but am willing to be at Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſal: At another time he uttered theſe words very audibly, <hi>I know that my redeemer liveth;</hi> and by and by he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the fifth verſe of the one and thirtieth Pſalme in Meter:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Into thy hand Lord I commit</l>

                     <l>For why, thou haſt redeemed it,</l>
                     <l>Oh Lord my God moſt true.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>He preſt the by-ſtanders ſo long as he was able to many wholſome du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; As to make ſure of Heaven in the time of health, to keep their evidences fair and unblotted, To remember and keep holy the Sabbath day, (of which he himſelf, as youl find hereafter, was a moſt careful obſerver.) When he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37480:22"/>could not ſpeak himſelfe, he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire others to read the Scriptures to him, directing to the places which he moſt deſired, which were for the moſt part the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> of <hi>David.</hi>

                  <p>On the tenth of <hi>July</hi> his ſpeech was quite taken from him, but yet his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and memory continued with him; and for the ſpace of four dayes he lay (as all about him might perceive) in a very comfortable condition, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up his eyes and hands towards Heaven with a ſmiling and cheerful countenance.<note place="margin">Qualis vita finis ita.</note> An upright life doth uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally end in a peaceable death.

                  <p>The 14 of <hi>July</hi> this ſhining light went out. Oh for young <hi>Timothys</hi> to ſtand up in the room of ſuch aged <hi>Pauls.</hi> He was buried the ſeventeenth day of

                  <p>What was ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, the ſame may be affirm'd of him, <hi>The zeal of God did conſume and eat him up.</hi>

                        <p>What is ſaid of another, may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo affirmed of him, That he was kin to Angels, who are active ſpirits, and a flaming fire.</p>
                     </note> Though he ſeldom ſinn'd in being angry, yet he often, very often, was angry with ſin. He could bear to be reproach't, and evil-ſpoken of himſelf, but not that God and his Name ſhould be blaſphem'd and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour'd: of this, I could give many inſtances, take one or two under his own hand. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>at a Wedding dinner, at the Marriage of one Mr.</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine's <hi>Servant, I obſerv'd a Fidler to ſwear and ſing very obſcenely, at which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37480:34"/>I was troubled and filled with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till anon I call'd to him to forbear, and gave him money to hold his peace, tendring therein the glory of God, and was much comforted thereby.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Supping once at an Inn, betwixt</hi> Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford <hi>and</hi> London, <hi>where many who Travell'd together, did alſo eat together, one amongſt the reſt was full of vain and prophane diſcourſe. I applied my ſelf to him, and laboured to convince him of the evil of ſin, and of the curſe and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy wrath of God which hung over his head: And then I told him alſo of the riches of Gods grace to repenting ſinners, of his readineſs to receive them, and be reconciled to them. This made him more mute, but what farther operation it had upon him, I know not; only this was remarkable, that the opening of the grace of God in the Goſpel, fell upon a young Scholar that ſtood by, and (as he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confeſt) it melted his very heart, and help't him from under a ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage wherewith he had been bow'd down, and broken, for many Months paſt.</hi>

                  <p>Another demonſtration of his great zeal for God, was his frequent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37480:35"/>and contriving how he might promote his honour and ſervice in the World. How often hath he been heard to ſay in a Morning to his Friend or Friends, Come, What ſhall we do for God this day? How ſhall we Trade with our Talents for the furtherance of his glory?

We make often mention of a gift of Prayer, and of a gift of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and I am ſatisfi'd that there is a gift of Conference, of godly and chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Conference, and I believe that he was endued with it, above any in this Age. As men have their particular ſins, ſo they have their particular gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and excellencies; <hi>Abraham</hi> excell'd in Faith, <hi>Moſes</hi> in Meekneſs, <hi>Job</hi> in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and this good man in godly Conference. Who ever convers'd with him, and did not hear ſome profitable Diſcourſe proceed from him? his <hi>ſpeech was alwayes with grace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4.29.</note> as it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu'd grace in the ſpeaker, ſo it was apt to work grace in the hearer: it was ever ſavoury, <hi>ſeaſon'd with ſalt, and good to the uſe of edifying.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 45.1, 2. Prov. 10.21.

One would wonder when he ſate at meat with his Friends, how dexterouſly he would turn Water into Wine. I mean, their merry and idle, into ſerious and uſeful Diſcourſe. When any were talking of their worldly and ſecular Affairs, he had a faculty of faſtning, or hitching on ſome heavenly Argument, which he did ſo handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the moſt ignorant and carnal amongſt them could not be offended at it; thoſe that would nauſeate ſuch Diſcourſe in others, would yet accept it from him, ſo cleanly and artificially did he manage it. He had a very good hand at <hi>warning the unruly,</hi> and at <hi>comforting the feeble-minded;</hi> but he was wondrouſly ready <hi>at inſtructing the ignorant,</hi> ſuch as others would ſlight, and not think worthy of their pains, by reaſon of their meanneſs and ignorance; he would delight in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with them, and inſtructing of them; <hi>their Souls,</hi> he would ſay, <hi>are as precious as the Souls of Nobles.</hi>

And ſome of them, who have often ſmelt the <hi>odour</hi> of his <hi>oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (for he was anointed with ſome gifts and graces above many of his Brethren) have ſpread abroad the <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> of it, by declaring what an <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirit was found in him;</hi> chiefly, that men might utter the memory of <hi>Gods great goodneſs</hi> to him, and to his Church in him; as alſo, that ſuch as never knew him, might, by beholding his <hi>Portraicture</hi> drawn (though, it may be, not to the life) be brought, by his example, to ſome conformity to that holineſs which did ſhine forth in him: and, laſtly, that ſo worthy a perſon might have the honour which is his due,<note place="margin">Pſal. 112.6.</note> and which the Lord alloweth to be paid to his faithful ſervants.</p>

                     <p>He was, in his younger years, choſen Scholar of <hi>Corpus Chriſti College</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and, not long after, <hi>Probationer Fellow</hi> of the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> before he came to be Batchelor of Arts, a thing ſeldom known in that houſe.

                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 5.7.</note> for at length he had his Conſcience ſprinkled with the <hi>blood</hi> of Chriſt, by whom he received the <hi>atonement;</hi> and <hi>the law of the Spirit of life, in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And now he became a Member of the moſt ancient, honourable, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Society</hi> in the world; being firſt choſen, and then admitted <hi>Fellow</hi> of <hi>Sion College,</hi> where an innumerable company of <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> were his <hi>Collegues.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Herb. 12.22.</note> Having received this grace, he found himſelf ſtrongly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to make others partakers of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, having taken his degree of <hi>Maſter of Arts,</hi> after ſome few Years, he left the <hi>College,</hi> and addicted himſelf to the work of the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</hi>

                     <p>As ſoon as he came upon the place, he manifeſted an earneſt deſire after the welfare of the <hi>Society,</hi> in every reſpect, exciting, and, by his example, leading ſuch as were to aſſiſt him to endeavour the ſame.</p>
                     <p>His Government ſavoured more of <hi>lenity</hi> and mildneſs, than of <hi>ſharpneſs</hi> and ſeverity; yet he kept the College in very good Order and Diſcipline. Though the Houſe, before his time, had been much troubled with diviſions, he, by his <hi>moderation,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> kept them all of a piece, and in the enjoyment of great peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>

                     <p>His great care was to promote <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> in the <hi>College,</hi> which he did with both his hands earneſtly. <hi>Divine</hi> knowledge, and <hi>Humane</hi> Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, are the <hi>right,</hi> and <hi>left</hi> eye of the World; as the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> are to the <hi>

                     <p>Hence have flown thoſe great heats, Animoſities, and <hi>perverſe Diſputings,</hi> which have ſo much troubled the Church of God. Unſanctified Parts and Learning have been the <hi>ſharpeſt Tools,</hi> that the great Adverſary of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and of the Church eſpecially, could ever lay hold on to do <hi>miſchief</hi> withall; as the Hiſtories of all Ages do abundantly teſtifie.</p>
                     <p>Upon ſuch accounts as theſe, this godly wiſe man was careful to prevent (if it might be) an error in the firſt concoction, knowing how hard it might prove to amend it in the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, when any Scholars place became void, if there appeared many <hi>Candidates</hi> for it, he appointed them ſome time before the Election, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him at his Lodgings, where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined them privately, and ſet down in a Paper the age, ſtanding, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37480:45"/>in learning of every one of them: He noted alſo, what Teſtimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als he had received from perſons of <hi>Integrity,</hi> concerning the good conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of any of them, and their hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs as to <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> with his own apprehenſions about them, upon his examination, as to that matter alſo.</p>
                     <p>And if ſuch a number of the Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors as was requiſite, could not, after publick examination, agree upon one of them; he, upon whom the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was, in that caſe, devolved; if there appeared to him an equality, or near an equality in other reſpects, would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes let Piety have the honour to turn the ſcale.</p>
                     <p>His next care was to have theſe <hi>Twins parts,</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> foſtered, and cheriſhed, and by all wayes and means improved, and heightned to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his power. To this purpoſe, he came, ordinarily, to all <hi>College</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, held every one to the duties of their ſeveral places; and obſerved
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37480:46"/>every ones growth, and progreſs in Learning; by which he was the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to judge whom to prefer, when any of them came to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors for a <hi>Fellowſhip.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was no leſs careful to ſee <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> thrive, and proſper among them: For firſt, he made choice of the fitteſt perſons he could find, to perform the duty of Prayer Morning and Evening, ſuch as might, with <hi>reverence, ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>warm affection,</hi> engage the hearts of others in the duty.</p>
                     <p>At this holy exerciſe he was preſent himſelf, as conſtantly, if not more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly than the younger <hi>Scholars,</hi> as to join in the duty, to bring down a bleſſing from above upon them, and their ſtudies; ſo, to ſee it reverently performed, and that the <hi>whole Society</hi> came duly together.</p>
                     <p>Every Lords day in the Evening, when the whole Houſe met to offer up their <hi>Sacrifice of praiſe, and prayer,</hi>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:37480:46"/>he examined the younger ſort, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to account about what they had heard that day; which was a likely means to engage them to the greater attention in hearing, and to make the truths, by their ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, ſink the deeper into their hearts.</p>
                     <p>He took great pains to inſtruct them of the lower rank in the grounds of <hi>Religion,</hi> calling them one day in the Week into the <hi>Chappel;</hi> where he opened, and explained the great, and <hi>weighty Truths of Chriſtianity</hi> to them; endeavouring ſtill, not only to inform their <hi>judgments,</hi> but to make the truths reach their <hi>hearts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereas, the <hi>Founder</hi> required, that the <hi>Fellows,</hi> and <hi>Scholars</hi> ſhould, at ſuch a ſtanding (as was ſaid before) be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to the <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> he, with the conſent of ſuch of the <hi>Fellows</hi> as were impowered by <hi>Statute</hi> to make orders for the good of the Society, decreed, That all of ſuch a ſtanding, or above,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37480:47"/>ſhould preach every Lords day in the morning, by courſe, in the <hi>College Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> before the publick Sermon in the <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>By this means, they, who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the Work of the Miniſtry, might, firſt, <hi>prove,</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> their own abilities. And ſecondly, <hi>approve</hi> themſelves to others, to be men <hi>apt to teach,</hi> which is one of the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons required in the <hi>Apoſtolical Canons</hi> in them that are to be called to the Paſtoral office.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly and laſtly, beſides the <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> which he had often in his own Lodgings about Soul-matters, and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> in the Lords Supper, in the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege Chappel,</hi> where he himſelf did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter, and many of the Houſe, with others from abroad were partakers; he was often diſcourſing, with ſuch of the Society as came to him about any buſineſs, in ſuch a manner as tended to the <hi>promoting of Holineſs;</hi> for he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom let them depart without ſome
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37480:47"/>inſtruction, admonition, or hearty counſel.</p>
                     <p>They eſpecially, who, by reaſon of their place and ſtanding, were moſt about him, received great benefit by converſing with him; <hi>For his heart taught his mouth, and added learning to his lips.</hi> When a portion of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture was read, at Dinner (as is uſual) he did not only cauſe <hi>altum ſilentium,</hi> and reverent attention through the Hall, that all might feed their <hi>Souls,</hi> while they were feeding their <hi>Bodies;</hi> but, the Chapter ended, if there were any difficult places in it, he either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded them to the <hi>Fellows</hi> that ſate at the Table with him, to be unfolded by them, or elſe opened, and unfolded them himſelf; if it contained practical matter, it was a pleaſant thing to ſee, and hear, how he, who applied his heart to the knowledge of God, and kept his words and Laws within him, <hi>had them withall fitted in his lips.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He lived to ſee ſome fruit of his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37480:48"/>Labours, to his great joy and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for a competent number of them, who were educated, <hi>ab origine,</hi> under his care, became Learned, well-diſpoſed, and pious men. I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain, but muſt mention one of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Joſeph Alleine,</hi> late Miniſter of the Goſpel at <hi>Taunton</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire;</hi> for as he was a great comfort to this holy man, while he continued in the <hi>College;</hi> ſo it did revive him to hear (for he was often enquiring after ſuch as had been of his Houſe, <hi>as a father after his children</hi>) that he proved ſo eminently pious, and uſeful a man in the Church of God.</p>
                     <p>But, had he lived to ſee the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Life, now publiſhed ſince his Death, he would have fallen into an <hi>extaſie</hi> of joy: And I have ſo much charity for ſome, that were inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal about his great Sufferings, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Impriſonments, as to believe, that if they would pleaſe to read the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aforeſaid, wherein both <hi>Conformiſts</hi> and <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> agree to give him
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37480:48"/>an high teſtimony for his great parts, Learning, peaceable ſpirit, quiet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, zeal of the right kind, with ardent love to God, and man, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the worſt of his enemies, their hearts would ſmite them for giving ſo good a man ſo much trouble: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he is, now, <hi>where the weary are at reſt,</hi> Job 3.17.</p>
                     <p>We have ſeen how vigilant, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious a Governour this worthy man was in his <hi>College;</hi> he was alſo one, who, in compaſſion to mens ſouls, took every opportunity, when at home, to Preach in, or near the City.</p>
                     <p>One of the <hi>Impropriations</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>College,</hi> about ſeven Miles diſtant, having but a ſmall ſtipend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time, not ſufficient to afford a ſubſiſtence to an able man to labour, and watch among the people for the good of their ſouls; he firſt went <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> afterward he deſired ſome of the <hi>Senior Fellows</hi> to go over by courſe,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37480:49"/>and Preach unto the people; which deſire of his they readily complied with, for ſome time, till the Leaſe of the <hi>Impropriation</hi> came to be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when, upon the <hi>Preſidents</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, the <hi>Fellows</hi> conſented either much to abate, or wholly remit the Fine; requiring, in lieu thereof, a competent Sum to be paid yearly, to encourage an able man to labour conſtantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
                     <p>When the Affairs of the <hi>College</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him forth into places remote from the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,</hi> he was alwayes ready to take any opportunity to do good to the ſouls of men.</p>
                     <p>One who hath rode many hundred Miles in company with him, hath alwayes obſerved his deportment in all places, and toward all perſons, to be ſuch as became an heavenly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and a true <hi>Miniſter</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>When he was <hi>riding on the way,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 6.7.</note> he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:37480:49"/>entertained his company with heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcourſe; and as variety of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects did preſent themſelves to him, he alwayes drew excellent matter out of them; glorifying God for the power, wiſdom, and goodneſs which appeared in the Works of <hi>Greation,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi>

                     <p>As he paſſed by ſuch as were about their occaſions in the <hi>Fields,</hi> he would many times make an halt, and enter into a ſhort diſcourſe with them: He would, firſt, ask them ſome ordinary queſtion, ſuch as Travellers uſe to ask, and then take an occaſion, from their anſwer, to ask them other queſtions of more weight and concernment to their Souls; leaving alwayes ſome ſerious word with them, at parting, for them to <hi>ruminate</hi> upon: And I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that there are many, who never ſaw his face, nor he theirs, but thus, <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> that have bleſt God for him.</p>

                     <p>He had an excellent gift, and rare faculty, beyond what I did ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in any man beſide, to improve diſcourſe ſo as to make it, not only <hi>pleaſant</hi> to thoſe with whom he did converſe,<note place="margin">

                     <p>When he came among perſons of <hi>Quality</hi> (being himſelf well born, well educated, of a generous ſpirit, and a chearful temper) his company, and converſe was, uſually, very <hi>acceptable to them,</hi> which gave him an advantage to tell them (as he would <hi>plainly,</hi> though <hi>prudently</hi>) of what he ſaw amiſs in them; to mind them of the vanity of the World, of better things
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37480:50"/>above, and to put them (as he often would) upon good deſigns, to ſhew their thankfulneſs to God for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to them.</p>
                     <p>Nor was there a perſon ſo mean, but he could, and would readily, and humbly condeſcend to him, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what precious ſouls dwell in the pooreſt <hi>houſes of clay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He ſpake to ſuch alwayes in their own dialect, and in a phraſe they well underſtood; trying their knowledge, and feeling the pulſe of their ſouls: if he found them ignorant, or unſenſible, he would endeavour to awaken them, by laying plain Texts of Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, for their conviction.</p>
                     <p>If he met with humbled and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened ſouls, or ſuch as were babes in Chriſt, he would gather them as <hi>lambs</hi> in his arms, and <hi>gently</hi> lead them to the <hi>Wells of Salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If at any time there hapned to be a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37480:51"/>mixt company at the Table with him, ſome ſerious Chriſtians, ſome Profeſſors at large, his manner was to be very free and pleaſant in diſcourſe with them, which cauſed them all to give great attention to him: then might you have ſeen, how, ever and anon, the honey dropt from his lips, while the company were hanging on them; how skilful he was in dividing the Word aright, to every one his portion; and how wiſe in winning of ſouls.</p>
                     <p>If he obſerved any to take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from his innocent mirth, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant humour, to incline to vain, and frothy diſcourſe, he would very dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly turn to ſome more profitable matter, and, as occaſion was given, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a ſerious reproof, tempered with much kindneſs and love to their ſouls, which was, uſually, well taken at his hand.</p>
                     <p>If his occaſions required his ſtay, a day or two, at any place, he ſeldom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted before he had Preached to the People.</p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:37480:51"/>
                     <p>He found, by much and long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that a plain way of Preaching was moſt effectual to the ends for which that Ordinance was appointed; and therefore he conſtantly uſed it, even in the <hi>College</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity;</hi> though he could eaſily have appeared in another ſtrain, had he preferred an aiery Reputation with ſome, before the Work of his Maſter, and the real ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of others.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, I hope, that many, who ſome time were, and ſome, who yet are members of that Society, having felt his fatherly care, heard his ſound and pious inſtructions, and ſeen his godly examples, do, and will endeavour to hold a conformity thereunto: If any neglect, or deſpiſe them, let them know aſſuredly, that God will require it at their hands.</p>

                     <p>True, Friend, when the breath departeth, the Soul departeth alſo, yet the Soul of a man is not his breath, becauſe 1. Beaſts, and the Fowls of the Air breathe; alſo and yet you do not think they have reaſonable, immortal Souls, as we have: 2. Our breath is but the Air drawn in, and caſt out again; and can you reaſonably imagine, <hi>firſt,</hi> that the Air thus ſucked in, and blown out again, ſhould be the Soul or Souls of men? or, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that the whole Region of the Air, ſhould be the rational and immortal Souls of men? or, <hi>thirdly,</hi> that our Souls come in and go out of our bodies, as the Air we breathe in doth?</p>

If our Souls were blood, then, when our Noſes bleed (to ſpeak fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly with you) our Souls would even out at our Noſes; or when we cut our fingers, our Souls would run out at our fingers ends.</p>

                     <p>Friend, if your faith and hope were right, you would find 1. A difficulty and hardſhip in believing; he that never doubted, or never believed; he that never ſaw his want of faith, never lamented his unbelief, hath cauſe to fear he hath no true ſaving faith at all. It's an eaſie matter to preſume, but it's a hard thing to believe, and hope aright in God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19. <hi>It's the exceeding greatneſs of the power of God toward us who believe, according to the working of his mighty power:</hi> ver. 20. <hi>Which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead.</hi> 2. Your faith and hope were they true, would be grounded upon the Word and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God. 3. Faith and hope, if right, would <hi>purifie the heart and life, Acts</hi> 15.9. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. Now whether you have this kind of faith and hope or no, you had need look to it.</p>

                     <p>Friend, but what if Chriſt did not dye for you? Your conceit that he did dye for you, will not ſerve your

                     <p>Friend, I'll tell you, it's not a believing that Chriſt dyed for ſinners, for that the Devils do; it's not a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that Chriſt dyed for me in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, for that, 1. Multitudes of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, and reprobates, do, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:37480:67"/>may do, in a way of preſumption: and, 2. Many a doubting Believer want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſurance, dare not ſay, I believe that Chriſt dyed for me in particular; now that conceit or preſumption which an ungodly man may have, and a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man may want, can't poſſibly be that faith which is juſtifying and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>

                     <p>Faith is, Friend, a receiving of Chriſt, as God the Father offers him in the Goſpel, as our King to rule us, our Prophet to teach us, as well as our Prieſt, who made ſatisfaction, and now makes interceſſion for us; it is alſo out of a ſenſe of our loſt eſtate in our ſelves, a reſting on him alone for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi>

                     <p>Friend, I fear not; for had you taken Chriſt as your King, you would not dare to allow your ſelf in ſinful courſes, as Swearing, and the like, which you cannot deny but you are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:37480:67"/>deeply guilty of; had you taken Chriſt as a Prophet, you would have been taught by Him, by his Word and Spirit, and have gotten ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at leaſt in theſe principles and fundamentals of Chriſtianity: Had you reſted upon Chriſt alone for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, you would not have told me as you did even now, that you hoped to be ſaved by your ſerving God, your good prayers, and the like, not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning a word of Jeſus Chriſt; which makes me fear, that as yet you are a meer ſtranger to Chriſt, and faith in Chriſt.</p>

You muſt know and acknowledge that you can do nothing of your ſelf by your own ſtrength; neither believe, nor repent, or the like. 2. You muſt by faith relie upon Chriſt, and Chriſt alone, who hath fulfilled the Law, ſatisfied his Fathers juſtice, and and paid the uttermoſt farthing, for all poor loſt Souls that come unto him. 3. You muſt pray hard, beg the Spirit of God to help your infirmities, to work all your works in you, and for you; and <hi>God hath promiſed to give his holy Spirit to them which ask him, Luke</hi> 11.13.</p>

Do you long to be the death of your ſins? is your hatred a mortal, a deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred? do you <hi>mortifie the deeds of the fleſh by the Spirit?</hi> Rom. 8.13. 3. Deal plainly and truly, as you will anſwer it at death and judgment, is there not ſome beloved ſin that you are loth to part with, loth to be told of by friends or Miniſters, ſome ſinful way of profit or pleaſure which you have no mind to leave, but allow your ſelf in it?</p>

By Ordinances, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand every part of that worſhip which God hath appointed, as Prayer, Preaching, Reading, Hearing, Singing Pſalms, the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. By the Word, I mean the Scriptures, wherein God revealeth his Will, and maketh himſelf known to the children of men. 5. By Works, I underſtand the works of Creation and Providence, whereby God revealeth much of himſelf to men who eye God in them.</p>

                     <p>Friend, it is to give them that inward and outward reſpect which is due to them, and to obey the lawful commands of thoſe who are over us.</p>

                     <p>Friend, you perceive again by this, that you have lived very ignorantly, mindleſs of knowledge, and of the things of God, and of the great concernments of your Soul, and of Eternity. Let me give you ſome good counſel before we part, it may be you and I ſhall never meet again; and as we never ſaw the faces one of another (for ought we know) before this day, ſo poſſibly we never may ſee each other again till the day of Judgments that great and terrible day of the Lord. Let me adviſe you, and the Lord perſuade your heart, 1. To make Conſcience of ſecret Prayer, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of God for Chriſt his ſake, that he would make you ſenſible of the ignorance, of the blindneſs of the mind of the hardneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency of the heart; of the careleſneſs and mindleſneſs of the ſpirit, in the great things of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:37480:83"/>grace and ſalvation, be earneſt with God to give you knowledge, and conſider <hi>that the ſoul be without knowledge is not good,</hi> Prov. 19.2. As alſo, for repentance from dead Works, and a true ſaving faith in Jeſus Chriſt. Beg of God an heart, to ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, and that you may be of thoſe who ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, and of thoſe violent ones who take the Kingdome of Heaven by force, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to hear good Miniſters preach, remembring what moſt concerneth you in what you hear. 3. Be much in ſearching the Scriptures, and reading of good Books, Catechiſms, and ſuch like. 4. Make choice of good Company, of ſuch as fear God, and walk preciſely, holily, righteouſly, and ſoberly in this preſent evil world, and improve ſuch acquaintance by good conference with them, putting ſuch queſtions to them as may make for your edification, and they, let me tell you, will be as glad of your ſociety, as you of theirs. 5. Be ſure if you have a Family, to ſet up the worſhip of God in your Family, reading the Scriptures, and praying morning and evening with the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold, Catechizing, and inſtructing your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants, if you have a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

This grace in ſpeech, is that pious prudence flowing from the Spirit of God, which ſanctifieth firſt the heart, and then guides and directs the Tongue and words, and makes them ſound and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, ſuitable and ſeaſonable, to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Conditions of others with whom we converſe. Remember, ſalt muſt be rubbed in, thruſt into holes and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; ſo ſpeech muſt be ſet on with life and warmth by the ſpeaker. But what, muſt our ſpeech in reference to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alſo be with grace, and ſeaſoned
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37480:99"/>with ſalt? yea, why not to Children, ſo farre as they are ſubjects capable and recipient of what is ſpiritual and good? What though the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and memories of Children be little narrow veſſels, yet, they are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day growing bigger and wider; and they are veſſels of God's making, and therefore good, and for good ends and purpoſes: and if parents and friends do not labour to fill theſe ſmall veſſels, and to ſeaſon them with the good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of Divine and wholſome truths, the Devil and his Inſtruments, wicked ones will beſtir themſelves to drop ſtore, great (I can't ſay good) ſtore of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome and poiſon into them, poſſibly for the tainting, ſowring, and infecting them, as long as they live. It's God's command, that Parents do <hi>bring up their Children in the nurture, and admonition of the Lord, Eph.</hi> 6.4. <hi>To bring up,</hi> that's natural; even the beaſts of the field, and fowles of the aire, bring up, feed their young, and cheriſh them. <hi>In the Nurture;</hi> that moral and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men, as men, if prudent, will doe: they keep their Children in awe,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37480:100"/>and order; therefore the Apoſtle adds, <hi>and admonition of the Lord,</hi> that's Chriſtian and ſpiritual. Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed will inſtruct their Children in the Principles of Religion, will put good things into their minds, (as the word imports) ſo farr and ſo faſt as their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities will take in, and their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries retain. If any demand what Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? at what age muſt they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed?? All the anſwer that I will give, is this; the Original word is large and Comprehenſive, takes in all that be born; and why ſhould I ſtraiten, or narrow it? Common reaſon will ſuggeſt, that the Childs capacity muſt be the parents guide and rule therein; nor is this the taking the Name of God in vain, as ſome ridiculouſly may fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it.</p>

There's not a word ſpoken for God, his truth, ordinances, day, his miniſters or people, that ſhall fall to the ground and be loſt; for God hath an Ear to hear all, and an hand to regiſter and record all; ſo that all will be upon the account of believers with Comfort in life, and death, at judgment, and to eternity.</p>

                  <p>The fourth Argument which ſhould provoke us to be much in the duty of Chriſtian Conference,<note n="4" place="margin">Gods end in the variety of gifts beſtowed.</note> is our anſwering therein Gods great end in his various diſtribution, of gifts and graces to his Children; which is, that by gracious diſcourſe and holy communication, they might mutually impart each to other for their edification, and ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. For the amplification thereof, an apter ſimilitude cannot be uſed, then that of the Apoſtle, drawn from a body natural, in which each member hath its proper gift, not for it ſelf one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but for the whole, and every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther member in particular; thus the Eye ſees, the ear heares, the Tongue ſpeaks, the hands work, the feet walk, not each for it ſelf onely, but for each other member, and the whole body: ſo in the Church of Chriſt, which is one body myſtical. Can. 6.9. <hi>My dove,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37480:108"/>my undefiled, is but one, one body,</hi> Can. 6.9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4. Yet in that one body there are variety of members, and God by his Spirit diſtributeth gifts and graces va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, <hi>dividing to every one ſeveraily as he will,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.11. But to what end? He anſwers it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>The manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withall.</hi> So in a body politick,<note place="margin">

So in the world, ſeveral Countries have their ſeveral commodities, and all to maintain mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Trade, Commerce, and converſe among men, but all for the good of the whole. What another Apoſtle ſpeaks in another caſe, in regard of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, is here by way of illuſtration fairely applicable, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>As eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man hath received the gift, ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God.</hi> There's much, very much of the wiſdome and goodneſs of God, in laying up rich
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:37480:109"/>treaſures of knowledge, and gracious experiences in the heads and hearts of ſome, not onely for their own uſe, but for the guiding and leading of others alſo. No member in the body natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or myſtical, but is deſigned to be, and ought to be uſefull and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the whole. The way to compaſſe our end with God, which is to be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly glorified by him, and with him, in the full enjoyment of him, is to give him his ends here on us,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.</note> which is that we ſhould glorify him, and that in laying out all our talents to the beſt advantage of our Maſter, and the uſe of his family, which is his Church and people here below; and this end is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly advanced, by the wiſe and frequent exerciſe of Chriſtian Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>The 5th Argument in reference to God,<note n="5" place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Goſpel.</note> which pleads hard for Chriſtian Conference, is, that it is powerfully ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious (by the bleſſing of God) for the propagation of the Goſpel, and for the bearing up of the Name, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and glory of God in the World from generation to generation. How
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37480:109"/>was the worſhip of God tranſmitted from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but by Oral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and that in Conference; Fathers declaring to their Children, and ſo from Children to Children, age after age? God at firſt revealed his will to <hi>Adam</hi> by word of mouth; and renewed the the ſame to the Patriarks, not by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but by ſpeech, by dreams, and other inſpirations: and thus the word of God went from man to man, for the ſpace of two thouſand and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, unto the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was the firſt penman of the Holy Scriptures; and all this while men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped God, and held the Articles of their Faith by tradition, not from men, but immediately from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And the Hiſtory of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament probably for the ſpace of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years at leaſt, went from hand to hand by tradition, 'till penned by the Apoſtles; or being penned by others, it was approved by them. And now the Canon of Scriptures being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, and by the infinite wiſdome, power and goodneſs of God, kept pure and entire, we muſt <hi>to the law and

So one generation runneth with the light of the Goſpel, to another gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſo from generation to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, I cannot ſay till the light go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out, (for it's an everlaſting Goſpel, and never goeth out) but 'till the light of grace be heightned unto, or ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the light of glory. The neceſſity and uſefulneſs of Chriſtian Conference, in order to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel amongſt us, and the propagation of it to poſterity, may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently be evinced, if we go a little to School to Prieſts and Jeſuites, to all Arch hereticks and ſeducers; do not they ſpread their opinions and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, even among ignorant ones and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate, meerly, or mainly by diſcourſe and conference? do not common ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, adulterers, ſcoffers, and the like rabble òf men, by their evil commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications corrupt good manners; and ſo propagate profaneneſs to Children, and Childrens Children? and what,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37480:111"/>ſhall Antichriſtian and unchriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference build up the Devils kingdom in the World, even-before our eyes, and under our noſes; and ſhall not Chriſtians indeed, real Saints, bethink themſelves, and beſtir themſelves, in promoting and advancing the intereſt and Kingdome of Chriſt by conferring and diſcourſing upon all occaſions, and faire opportunities, and that with good and bad, for the building up the one, and gathering in of the other, and edifying of both? It's pitty, a thouſand pitties, that <hi>England</hi> ſhould run the hazard at leaſt of looſing the Goſpel, for want of ſuch Conference and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, as is by God himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, and well becomes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Goſpel. Will not our Forefathers riſe up in judgment againſt this preſent generation, and condemn it, ſaying, we primitive Chriſtians, and we their ſucceſſors, have by our Holy Conference, as well as by our Prayers and practice, tranſmitted and handed down the Goſpel to you of this Age: Yea the Martyrs and Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors may ſay, we have ſent the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37480:112"/>purified and refined by, and through our flames, and ſwimming to you in our blood; and have you now fooled away the Goſpel by ſinful ſilence, as to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying diſcourſe; and by ſinfull talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs, as to vaine diſputations, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſtrife, to the multiplying of rents and diviſions? How ſhall we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it to God, to conſcience, or to the Children yet unborne, if this ſhould be their doleful diſcourſe hereafter. Had not <hi>England</hi> once the Goſpel? O yes, in ſuch a Kings, and ſuch a Queens Reigns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what's now become of the Goſpel? how comes it to paſs that we their ſad poſterity are thus left in the dark? why, it was not the Lion and the Bear, the Turke, or the Pope, that cut down, or deſtroyed the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; but it was the little Foxes, the ſubtile Jeſuites, and their Agents and Factors, ſimple and ſilly ones by them deluded, yet witty and active enough, to divide the Profeſſors in <hi>England,</hi> and break them in pieces. Now let each believer preſently <hi>put on the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God, praying alwayes,</hi> Eph. 6.13, to 18. Prayers and Tears are good wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37480:112"/>and among the reſt fall round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon, and buckle cloſe to, this great duty of Chriſtian Conference; let every one of us ſay with that Holy man, <hi>Awake, up my glory—I my ſelf will awake early,</hi> Pſal. 57.8. Let our ſleepy Tongues, (that inſtrument whereby God may ſo much be glorified) awake, ariſe, get up and be doing, in this great work of Chriſtian Conference, which if well ordered and managed, might be a Compendious way (by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God) to win all the World to Jeſus Chriſt, which to deſign and attempt would be one of the beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects imaginable: Let families begin, ſet up Religion in their Houſes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their Children, and ſo their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Children, that the knowledge, faith, and fear of God may run in a bloud, in a line or pedigree, as <hi>unfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned faith in young Timothy, but firſt in his Grandmother Lois, and then in his Mother Eunice,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.5. and from Families to Pariſhes, from Pariſhes to Counties, and ſo to Kingdoms, and ſo throughout the World.

I need not give any farther confirmation by Scripture: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant experience, not alone of Miniſters, but or private Chriſtians, who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have been ſound in the Faith, and whoſe hearts filled with a zeal for God, and with love to, and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their erring brethren, and who thereupon have laid out themſelves much in Chriſtian Conference with them; I ſay their abundant experience of good ſucceſs may ſave me the labour of farther enlargements herein.

I have had occaſionally diſcourſe with Papiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Juſtification by works; with more, touching Salvation by living up to the light within them; with more yet, who hoped to be ſaved by their good Prayers, ſerving of God, leading a good life, doing as they would be done by, and the like; ſeveral of them in each ſort well-meaning people I hope, yet all ſplit upon the ſame rock, works, works, whereas the Scriptures ſay expreſly, <hi>By the deeds of the Law, there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight,</hi> Rom. 3.20. And again, <hi>By grace are ye ſaved, through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God: not of works, leaſt any man ſhould boaſt,</hi> Eph. 2.8, 9. Not to multiply quotations, ſo well known to all who ſearch the Scriptures, take
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37480:118"/>but one more, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not by works of righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his mercy, he ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> It is <hi>(by)</hi> as the way, not <hi>for</hi> as the deſerving and meritorious cauſe of ſalvation, that is <hi>Chriſt, and none but Chriſt,</hi> Act. 4.12. But to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance a little for Papiſts; I know not any by me reduced, I hope many are by others, and I rejoyce therein, and bleſs the Lord for it. For the ſecond ſort, who expect Salvation by living up to the light within them (a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men as much to be pittied, prayed for, and tenderly dealt with, as any, who by reaſon of ſome opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and practices lie under the wrath of men, and for others, without breach of Charity, we may ſay, lie under the wrath of God) onely one I can ſpeak of, a fellow paſſenger with my ſelf and others in an hackny Coach from St <hi>Albans</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> who after long and warme diſputes, at length ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confeſſed, that no righteouſneſs but the righteouſneſs of Chriſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, could availe for ſatisfaction
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37480:119"/>to God the Father, nor for our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſalvation, or to this effect. For the third ſort, thoſe who hope to be ſaved by their good prayers, their ſerving God, and ſo forth, think, and profeſs they think, their repentance and good deeds for time to come, will make amends for their bad deeds in time paſt, and make ſatisfaction to God for all that formerly hath been done amiſs by them: I hope by the good hand of God upon weak endeavours, (the whole of glory be the Lords) many have been plucked out of this ſnare of the Divel. I perceive this work groweth upon my hands, take but one inſtance therefore. There was ſome few years ſince, a young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, who waited on a Lady in a Noble mans family, who paſſing by Coach with others and my ſelf from <hi>Barnet</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> upon diſcourſe I ſoon found that this young woman had a devotion, and a zeale for God, cared not for vain frothy Company, gave her ſelf to reading Scriptures, and good Books, ſhe was well read, talked wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and underſtandingly; at laſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37480:119"/>diſcourſing with her, and putting que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to her touching Juſtification, I perceived, ſhe built much upon works, and a legall righteouſneſs; whereupon my bowels yerned towards her, and I told her in plain termes I feared ſhe was not yet in the way of life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and I ſpake as ſeriouſly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently as I could, ſhewing the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of all our own righteouſneſſes, and the impoſſibility of juſtification, life and ſalvation to be had by the deeds of the Law; and withall opened the Covenant of grace to her, how that it was Chriſt, and he alone, that was made under the Law to redeem them who were under the Law; of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſufficiency, and alſo willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and readineſs in him to ſave us: and to this effect I diſcourſed about half an hour together; and perceiving that ſhe had pulled her hood over her face, and was weeping, I held my peace; dropping a few words ſometimes; at length, ſhe breaks out in expreſſions to this purpoſe; Now Sir, I ſee the mind of God towards me this day, which is to bring me off from that ſandy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37480:120"/>of works which I have been building upon this many a day, and to bring me to free grace in Jeſus Chriſt, ſo ſetting me upon that rock which is higher then I; and I bleſs the Lord that I ſaw your face this day, that I fell into your company; the good I hope I have received from you will ſtick by me and comfort me as long as I live. I hear and believe that her Converſation ever ſince hath not been a diſhonour to her profeſſion, and that ſhe hath not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the advance of Religion at all in that noble family, but a means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it rather.</p>

That Chriſtian Conference may be uſeful, and availeable even for the Converſion of obſtinate and rebellious ſinners, I make no queſtion; the place forecited aboundantly proves it: for whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 15.19, 20. <hi>He that converteth a ſinner from the errour of his way;</hi> by <hi>ſinner</hi> we muſt needs take in ſuch as are vicious and flagitious in life and converſation, as well as one <hi>erring from the truth,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons erronious and Heretical. Again, <hi>Pauls</hi> injuction <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.29. <hi>Let no rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37480:120"/>communication proceed out of your mouth, but ſuch as may Miniſter grace to the hearers:</hi> and why not Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grace miniſtred, and regeneration work wrought even by Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? This I may ſafely ſay, that the Miniſters of Chriſt, have been not only by the publick Preaching of the word, but by private Conference, very inſtrumental under God in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting many ſouls to righteouſneſs; and the ground hereof to me is plain and abvious, becauſe Chriſt ſetteth them apart on purpoſe for that work, <hi>and gave gifts to men,</hi> Eph. 4.11, 12, 13. <hi>He received gifts, even for the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them,</hi> Pſ. 68, 18. And though private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and Miniſters ſpeak the ſame words, yet there's this difference, that what private Chriſtians ſay in Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, comes from fraternal Charity; what the meſſengers of Chriſt ſay, comes from ſpeciall miniſterial autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and their diſcourſing about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion is properly enough preaching, and hath been eminently inſtrumental for the Converſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37480:121"/>from darkneſs to light, and from the Kingdome of Satan unto God.

Let me leave you but one inſtance, which may by the Lords bleſſing be an incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this too much neglected duty of Chriſtian Conference. There is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt able Miniſter, who within theſe two years told me it for a piece of News, (and indeed it was welcome newes to me) and it was this, That in the Knights Family with whom he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth (the Knight is of good quality and repute) there was a maidſervant, he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believed fearing God <hi>in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi> which (to uſe his own words) da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her Converſion from my diſcourſe with her, walking up <hi>Highgate</hi> Hill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whereupon I remember'd that about four years ſince I came from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in an Hackny-Coach for St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and there was a Gentlewoman (I'le ſpare her name) with this her maid,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37480:121"/>and others; the Gentlewoman was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and willingly maintained good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on the way; and it being a cold morning, I at the bottom of the Hill went out of the Coach, to walk up the Hill, and warm my ſelf thereby; when I was out, the Maid asked leave of her Miſtriſs (who ſtayed in the Coach) that ſhe being cold might go up the Hill alſo, which ſhe did; and we talked together as we went; and I think the ſumme of my diſcourſe was our miſery by nature, our diſability to help our ſelves by any thing we could do or ſuffer, that there was an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute indiſpenſable neceſſitie of getting an intereſt in Chriſt, who was infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able and willing to ſave every poor loſt ſoul that came unto him by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and to this purpoſe, both in Coach and in walking: which the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe and infinitely gracious Lord God it bleſſed for the Spiritual and Eternal good of this poor handmaid; for which let his Holy Name be for ever glorified, and let all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians take from hence incouragement to be yet more and more abounding

I'le leave one inſtance in this caſe alſo; It's near twenty years ſince, that ſeveral Travellers of us paſſing between <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> ſupped together at an Inne in <hi>Great-Wickham,</hi> one of the company carried himſelf ſo untowardly and offenſively, that others at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wondered at me for my not rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him; whether thinking it prudence to forbear at ſupper time, or rather through my want of zeale for God, I know not, but ſupper being fully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37480:123"/>I addreſſed my ſelf, as well as I could, to ſpeak to this vaine perſon, which accordingly I did, laying firſt the Law before him, and the ſadneſs of his condition at preſent, and that, if he died impenitently, he was like to periſh eternally; after which I opened the Goſpel to him, with as much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and compaſſion as I poſſibly was able, acquainted him with the readineſs that is in God and Jeſus Chriſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive penitent ſinners; and how thoſe that came to Chriſt, he would in no wiſe caſt out; and many ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to this purpoſe, that grace diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered might win and allure him to Chriſt, and to repentance. Yet what impreſſion all that was ſpoken had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that vain perſon, I know not.

And the reaſon hereof is ſtrong and weighty, becauſe good conference, if right in the ſpring, flowing from an heart fired with zeal for God, and love to my neighbour; and right in the ends, it deſignes Gods glory, and the good of the hearers; is a cleare evidence of a good and gracious heart; and grace makes way for peace, as the needle for the thred, ſo that thoſe who much lay out themſelves in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Conference, have, or may expect to have, yea be ſure, firſt or laſt, ſhall have much inward peace and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſpirit.

Before I go off, let me hint this by way of Caution, that when we ſpeak, or rather Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf ſpeaketh of Councel in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God, or of Gods acting upon Counſel, it is not to be underſtood properly: for to act upon Counſel, that implies Conſultation, and Conſultation a defect in knowledg (which to fancy concerning God would be high and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37480:128"/>Blaſphemy) but to be underſtood of God after the manner of men; the wiſeſt of men act upon Counſel: now becauſe all that God doth, is infinitely well and wiſely done, therefore he is ſaid to act by Counſel, as men do; But I have done with this great Argument, to preſs Chriſtian Conference, drawn from its profitableneſs and uſefulneſs; it's beneficial to the heads of our ſelves and others, in the augmentation of gifts and parts; to the hearts of our ſelves and others, in the communication of, and receiving of ſpiritual good ſeveral ways, beneficial in regard of inward peace at home in our own Conſciences, and outward peace abroad, with men, amongſt whom we live; &amp; which crowns all, it hath a marke of honour ſet upon it by the hand of God himſelf: &amp; he whom God honours, is honourable indeed.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto the Arguments exciting to Chriſtian Conference have been dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the duty we owe to God, and man, our ſelves, and others, and ſo from the ten Commandements; ſome other arguments may fairly be drawn from the Creed, or the Articles of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith.</p>

Solitarineſs and being alone fits beſt for meditation and muſing. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and being in Company calls for ſpeech and language.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37480:129"/>among Saints, as Saints, without Chriſtian Conference? to what end hath God and nature given us Tongues, ſpeech and language, but to glorifie him therewith, and to edifie one another? and that's mainly done in the way of Chriſtian Conference. Yet farther, it's one of the branches of the Communion of Saints, to keep others in the right ways of truth, and holineſs; and a likely means conducing thereunto, is to be much in good diſcourſe with others. It's hard to keep the way when one's alone, for man by nature is apt to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Many Travellers together may help to guide one the other, to keep from falling, or to raiſe up if fallen. <hi>Two are betten then one</hi> (ſaith the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4.9, 10.) <hi>for if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but wo to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.</hi> Great is the benefit of Society, from that natural helpfulneſs, which thereby one man affordeth to another. When the Lord imployed his ſervants in high works, he uſually ſent them Two by Two, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37480:130"/>reference to whom, we read of <hi>Two witneſſes:</hi> and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt when he ſent forth his Diſciples, they went Two and Two; and why this? Not onely that they might be joynt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the truth of the Doctrine, and meſſages delivered, but withall, that they might with more eaſe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs carry on the Miniſtery and work wherein they were imployed, and help mutually to ſtrengthen, to encourage, and comfort one the other. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance given, is pertinent to our purpoſe, <hi>for if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow.</hi> What fall? why ſociety is helpful in all kinds of falls, as corporal, in a journey, on foot, or horſe-back; or falls into diſeaſes, dangers, temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſins, errours; the ſociety of friends is uſeful, to pitty, to ſupport, to reſtore, to convince, to comfort, and every way to Miniſter ſubtable ſupplies and relief. To cloſe up and ſtrengthen this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that Chriſtian Conference, as it is a part of the Communion of Saints by ſpecial promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1. <hi>Behold, how good, and how pleaſant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity.</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:37480:130"/>Cohabitation, or dwelling together, is inſignificant without Communication, and Converſation becoming the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and why ſo good, ſo pleaſant? <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>For there the Lord commanded the bleſſing, even life for evermore.</hi> The illuſtration whereof the Pſalmiſts gives, in two lively and emphaticall ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes: <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>It is like precious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the head of Aaron.</hi> It was not the ointment in the box or vial ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but poured out, that gave the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant ſavour, and was ſo odoriferous: it is not grace in the heart (though that is ſaving) but grace in the lips and life, which makes a Chriſtian indeed ſo ſweet and ſavoury. <hi>Aaron</hi> in his oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments going about, was as a Pillar or Cloud of perfumes walking, leaving a ſweet ſcent and ſmell behind him: ſuch are Chriſtians indeed in their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications and Converſations, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and companies, into which the hand of Providence leadeth them. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimilitude is alſo very elegant and expreſſive, <hi>As the dew of Hermon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. The dew on the earth is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, makes it moiſt, ſoft, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:37480:131"/>full: ſuch in an higher, nobler, and more ſpiritual way, is Chriſtian Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, well and wiſely managed, to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers who are humble, conſcientious, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, docil, and tractable.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond argument moving to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Conference,<note n="2" place="margin">Arg. The day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> in relation to the Creed, and things to be believed, is fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtrongly deducible, from that great and dreadful day of judgment wherein an account muſt be given as well of words, as of actions, before that righteous Judge, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who hath foretold us,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.26, 27.</note> 
                     <hi>that every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give an account thereof in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned.</hi> An idle word is that which in it ſelf hath no tendency to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſpeaker or hearer, to profit men,<note place="margin">Par. in loc.</note> or honour God. Chriſt, our great Lord and Maſter, entruſteth men as ſtewards with much treaſure, to be laid out for their Maſters uſe: part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is that of the Tongue and language, which certainly he will call men to an account for; and if for idle words, then ſurely for reviling bitter and ſlandering
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:37480:131"/>words againſt the righteous ones, his ſervants and Children, Miniſters, or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now ſome ungodly men think, that the worſt words of their mouths are too good for them, calling them hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, diſſemblers, factious, ſeditious, traytors, rebels, and what not? <hi>ſepak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all manner of evil againſt them falſly,</hi> or <hi>lying,</hi> and <hi>reproachfully,</hi> Mat. 5.11. But they will be of another mind another day, when Chriſt cometh, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. <hi>And behold, the Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his Saints, to execute judgement upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodily committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches, which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him,</hi> Jude 14.15. By the way obſerve, that what evil is done to, or ſpoken againſt Chriſts little ones, he looketh upon as done to, or ſpoken againſt himſelf; but that which is principally to our purpoſe, is that Chriſt will then <hi>convince</hi> ſinners, force them to know and acknowledge that their ſpeeches of and againſt the righteous, were hard ſpeeches; and that conviction will be a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:37480:132"/>dreadful and terrible Conviction, he will convince them with a witneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world; convince them with a vengeance; convince them by the flames of Hell, a dreadful diſmal and everlaſting conviction indeed, but very juſt and righteous. They would not be convinced by the cleare, ſweet and pleaſant light of the word, Law or Goſpel, to their humiliation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall be convinced by the fire of Hell, though to their terrour, and confuſion. As ſome letters writ with joyce of Lemons or Onions are not le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible by common day light; but held to the fire, and a little ſcorched, are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible enough: ſo ſin and guilt in the Conſciences of ſome wretched ſinners, are never read by the common-light of the word; but when their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are held cloſe to the flames of Hell, and well ſcorched, then will they, nill they, their ſins and guilt are made clearly legible and viſible unto them, filling them with everlaſting horror, with ſhame and confuſion of face for ever: O the ſad and doleful reckoning that ſinners will make before that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:37480:132"/>Tribunal and Judgment ſeat of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt for words onely (to paſs by thoughts and actions) then Conſcience, throughly awaken'd, and terrified, will be forced to ſpeak, and ſpeak out, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing poor loſt ſinners; <hi>Imprimis,</hi> for idle words, multitudes, multitudes, even innumerable; <hi>Item,</hi> for lying, ſcoffing, ſlandering, defaming words againſt the Saints of the moſt high God; <hi>Item,</hi> for Curſing, Swearing, yea blaſphemous words againſt the moſt High God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, taking his Name in vaine, all the day long; and each of theſe by hundreds, thouſands, yea poſſibly mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions; O, What will the total ſum amount unto! tremble ſinner, tremble to imagine. To Cloſe up this, we read in the parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> Luk. 16.24. <hi>That the rich man in Hell</hi> complains particularly and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <hi>of his Tongue,</hi> how that was <hi>tormented in the flame.</hi> An an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writer gives this reaſon, his Tongue was that member which moſt ſinned, and therefore that had the ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt torment. Thus we ſee how the bad words of wicked men will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menbred
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:37480:133"/>and repeated to their ſhame and anguiſh at the laſt day; and no queſtion the good words of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall not be forgotten, <hi>They ſhall be had in everlaſting remembrance,</hi> Pſal. 112.6. and their words alſo, as the Prophet teſtifieth, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>They that feared the Lord ſpake often one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a book of remembrance was written with him:</hi> God booked down every word they ſaid; O what great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement ſhould this give to all that fear God, to be much in ſpeaking of God, and for God, to and with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What, ſhall the great and glorious, good and gracious Lord God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, vouchſafe to write down every good word which droppeth from us, and ſhall not our lips drop apace, and that as the Hony-comb, the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt words imaginable, tending to the glory of God, and good of men? did we indeed believe this one truth, O how would it ſet all our Tongues a going? how would every one ſtrive, who ſhould talke moſt, and ſpeak faſteſt? vying as it were, and contending which of us ſhould have the moſt words in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:37480:133"/>Chriſts book at the day of his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Its unbelief friends, it's unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which makes us ſo Tongue-tied, tieth up the ſtrings both of hearts and Tongues. Let's get, yea the Lord give us more faith, and then we ſhall be more talkative, in a good ſenſe, and to good purpoſe; and ſo God will be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and our neighburs edified; we and they ſhall have more heights of grace here, and weights of glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. I will Cloſe up this argument with <hi>Johns</hi> Viſion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. <hi>I ſaw the dead,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſmall and great, ſtand before God: and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of thoſe things, which were written in the books, according to their works.</hi> Alluding, I ſuppoſe, to the manner of judiciarie proceedings by Judges, who have depoſitions upon record. Judge according to the Laws of the Land, and matters of fact, cleared to them by alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and proofs: this ſtill remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, God needeth none of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords or books, but condeſcending to our capacities, he is pleaſed to ſpeak
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:37480:134"/>of himſelf after the manner of men. What the books are that ſhall be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is not fully agreed upon; ſome think, the Books of the Old and New Teſtament, wherein God hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed what was to be done by men, and what not to be done; and that becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. <hi>In that day, when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to my Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> Others, by the books, underſtand the Conſciences of men, which ſhall then be fully opened, and the ſecrets of all hearts be revealed: ſo that none ſhall be able to complain of injury done him, or injuſtice in God. Becauſe every mans Conſcience ſhall excuſe or accuſe, abſolve or condemn him, and give him clear and full information, whether he did indeed, or did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jeſus Chriſt, Faith in Jeſus Chriſt being the only condition of the New-Covenant, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not ſhall he damned. To preach this, is to preach the Goſpel.</hi> Which of theſe two Books ſhall be opened, I dare not determine; why not both, Scriptures,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:37480:134"/>and Conſciences? but theres' mention of <hi>another book to be opened,</hi> which is expreſly called, <hi>The Booke of Life:</hi> to wit, in which God from Eternity hath written the names of thoſe who ſhall be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, which is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelations:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.5.13.8. <hi>chap.</hi> 17.8.</note> Not that God needs or hath a Book; it would be ſimplicity and blaſphemy, to fancy it; but it is ſo expreſſed after the manner of men, to ſhew the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Predeſtination, immutability of Election, and the Infallibility of the Salvation of Gods Elect. But I forget what I have in hand. Can we ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally immagine, that when the book of Conſcience is opened, words will not he as legible as works? yea not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly works, and words, but thoughts alſo, <hi>and every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil:</hi> wherein Scripture is ſo expreſs, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. O let us remember and lay to heart, that at the laſt day, it will be known to all the world what good Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication the Saints have had, and what bad the ſinners; it's matter of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the one, but of Terror to the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:37480:135"/>others: Let us all fear and tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this great and glorious Lord our God, who taketh moſt exact notice of every word we ſpeak, and will, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, call us to an account for what good or hurt we have done by our words and communications, as well as by our works and actions; let this be as a bitt orbridle in out mouths to curb and reſtraine us from vaine and ſinful language, and yet be as a ſpur in our ſides to put on, quicken, and mend out pace in holy, heavenly, and Chriſtian Conference.</p>
                  <p>I have been much larger than I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, yet I would well hope not too large, in arguing for the advance and increaſe of Chriſtian Conference amongſt ſuch as profeſs Chriſtianitie.

For knowledge guides the motions of our lips, as eyeſight doth the motions of our feet. A blind man muſt be lying, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or ſtanding ſtill; if he will be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſoon ſtumbles, and falls.

                  <p>A third preparative direction,<note n="3" place="margin">Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> for the promoting of Chriſtian Conference, in all places and companies where we come, is to <hi>begin at home</hi> each Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſetting it up and keeping it up in his own houſe and Family, that ſo wife, Children, and ſervants, may gain an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of good and ſavoury diſcourſe, to be acted and exerciſed when you or they go abroad; as children, mannerly, or rude and unmannerly at home, uſe ſo to carry themſelves abroad alſo: and ſuch talk and diſcourſe as is uſed at home by husbands and wives, Parents and Children, Maſters and Servants, is like to be their language abroad alſo. The Lord by <hi>Moſes</hi> gives his peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:37480:154"/>command, as to good diſcourſe in families, <hi>Theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thy heart; and thou ſhalt talk of them, when thou ſitteſt in thy houſe, and in thy lying down, and riſing up,</hi> Deut. 6.6, 7. Such was wiſe King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> practice, which gave occaſion to <hi>Sheba</hi> Queen of the South in her Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſit to him, to ſay unto him, <hi>Happy are theſe thy ſervants, which ſtand conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually before thee, and that hear thy wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> &amp;c. Cuſtome is another nature: uſe legs, and have legs: uſe memory, and have memory: uſe good diſcourſe, and you will have good diſcourſe. I have ſeen Children, boyes and girles, had to neighbour houſes, upon occaſion of feaſting, viſits, or the like; and when their parents call upon them for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſaying, ſirra, where's your hat, and your leg, and girle; where's your Curſy? but no hat off, no leg or Curſy made, why? not uſed to it at home. So when we come into Chriſtian Company, and we provoke our ſelves to carry on good diſcourſe, and ſay, <hi>Awake my glory,</hi> Anſwer is given, no, ſleep at home, muſt ſleep abroad alſo. Acts frequent beget
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:37480:154"/>habits acquired, and ſtrengthen infuſed. A dexterity in the managing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Confernece aright, as to matter, manner, principles, and ends, is I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, an infuſed habit, a ſpecial gift of God.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.4.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I ſhould know how to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary. [Given me,]</hi> that is, me the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in his meaſure; or rather, <hi>given me,</hi> is meant of Chriſt, on whom the Spirit is poured without meaſure, yet ſo as that every believer hath his proportion of the Spirit, and ſo of this gift and habit of Chriſtian Conference to be uſed, and ſo improved and ſtrengthen, by a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and vigorous acting of it for the glory of God, and the good of our ſelves and others, with whom we have occaſion to converſe. Let it be one of thy Chriſtian exerciſes, to act and ſtrengthen this habit, day by day, in this language and communication.</p>
                  <p>A fourth preparative direction may be repentance and <hi>humiliation</hi> for our great failing in our great neglect of ſo great a duty as Chriſtian Conference is.<note n="4" place="margin">Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</note> We ſpend little of our time and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:37480:155"/>ſtrength in this duty, to wit, in ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe as hath a proper and direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, to the converſion or edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the hearers; we are much, if not too much upon this talk, what newes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad? ſpeaking of perſons, this body, or that, magnifying ſome too high, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying and depreſſing others too low; poſſibly erring in a way of flattery on the one hand, or of envy and hatred on the other; blameworthy in both.</p>
                  <p>A fifth Direction I would give, <note>5 <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                     </note> is, the pouring out a prayer to God in faith and love every morning, that he would guide thy diſcourſe all the day long.

Thus farr concerning our habitual preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Chriſtian Conference. Now tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching actual execution, when we are in company, take theſe following directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which may fall under two heads; Negative directions, and poſitive.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Negatives to be cautioned againſt and carefully avoided.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>outward man,</hi> that the body be not diſtempered, and ſo indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for ſo ſpiritual a piece of ſervice as Chriſtian Conference is, as by intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, or exceſs in eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which hath a ſpice of gluttony or
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:37480:156"/>drunkenneſs in it, when it unfits for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or this duty among the reſt. Meats and drinks immoderately taken in, fill the head with fumes and vapors, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to ſleep rather then diſcourſe: if the mouth take in too much, the tongue is likely to ſend out too little, as to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference heavenly and ſpiritual. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is to ſoul as the inſtrument to the Muſician: let the Muſician be never ſo skilful, yet if the inſtrument be out of tune, there's like to be but little melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Though the head be full of good notions, clear and ſtrong, the heart ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with grace and good affections, yet a diſordered body marrs the muſick of holy diſcourſe and Conference.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Beware of <hi>irregular paſſions,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances in the affections, the lower part of the ſoul of man.

Paſſions when boiled up to an undue heat and height, do no more befriend the intellect in it's reaſonings and argumentations, then foggs, miſts, and clouds, do the Sun in its ſhinings; not at all, they obſcure and much darken the Sun and ſo doth paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reaſon.</p>

And now I am accidently (as it were) fallen upon this Theame, give me leave to ſpeak ſomething concerning this kind of talk; though it be a digreſſion, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:37480:159"/>ſhould be ſomewhat a large digreſſion; yet by the bleſſing of God, it may be for his glory, and the ſpiritual good of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or hearers; which I deſire may run in three ſtreams, 1.

He oft ſtrikes and harps upon this meery ſtring. When he ſaith <hi>there is nothing better</hi> &amp;c. he ſpeaketh not abſolutely and ſimply, for the love and favour of God in Chriſt, the fear of God ſeaſoning our hearts, is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yea, the aſſurance of the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our perſons and ſervices is better alſo, as being the ground and occaſion of our mirth and merriment; as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, <hi>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works, Eccl.</hi> 9.7. The root is better in the fruit, the cauſe in the effect; <hi>To know our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God</hi> in all our natural and civil mirth and merriment, though it be alſo honeſt and lawful. So that when he ſaith <hi>nothing is better,</hi> he ſpeaks
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:37480:160"/>comparatively, that riches, houſes, lands are good, but the comfortable injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them is better, uſing them to the glory of God, to the chearing up and refreſhing our ſelves and others, doing good with them, and rejoycing in God in the liberal, yet ſober uſe of them. And to be ſure, the Spirit of God in <hi>Solomon</hi> had no mind by theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to patronize Epicuriſme, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, gluttony, drunkenneſs; though ſome wanton prophane wits may ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to wreſt ſuch a carnal liberty from them; which to do hath in it a ſpice of blaſphemy.</p>
